## Reading
Mandatory: [Sorry ARIMA, but Iâ€™m Going Bayesian](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/04/21/forget-arima/) Kim Larsen (MultiThreaded, SF)  blog post on bayesian vs non-bayesian tsa

Optional: [Is Seattle Really Seeing an Uptick In Cycling?](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/10/is-seattle-really-seeing-an-uptick-in-cycling/) an excellent analysis of time series by Jake Vander Plas (UW e-science center)

In class I mentioned JVP Seattle bike-share analysis (now optional reading) as the weekly reading assignment. I switched cause I think this is more interesting. It is also a bit more difficult. Still the concepts are accessible to all of you. The code is in R, but you do not have to work with it, and it is R is straightforwardly readable.

## ASSIGNMENTS:

### Assignment 1 (and only). Work from the [skeleton notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/HW10_fb55/subway_timeseries_instructions.ipynb) with inline instructions.
**Turn in as a notebook on your repo, as usual**, you can work in groups as usual, have a statement of the work balance in the group as usual.
