# PUI2016 HW 9

## Different assignments are due on different dates due to thanksgiving. 

## Reading

This Politico article contains several quotes by CUSP Prof Julia Lane. 
[Is Washington Bungling the Census?](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/11/federal-data-collection-in-crisis-000537)

This article is politically charged. Generally I strive to give you impartial, non-political views on topics, but I could not find a more impartial paper on the issues the census is undergoing. Yet I think the census data is extremely important for you as urban scientist so you should pay attention to this.

Also if you are interested (but not mandatory):
[Historians and the Census: the Historiography of
Census Research](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9478&context=annals-of-iowa)



## Assignment 1: reviews of classmates' plots. 
## Due next week, before thanksgiving. Work on this assignment alone. 

You will recieve an email with 3 names and github handles of classmates. Review their plots according to the things we discussed last class. You can discuss your review with others but each of you should submit a review for each of the plots

There will be detailed instructions in the email on how to review, what structure the review should have, what to focus on, etc. Please comply to the instructions. 
Upload the review **on your github PUI2017 HW9 repo** (AND ALSO in your classmate's HW8 repo, NOT JUST your _your fork_ of their repo!). Please note the numbers: I will grade what is in your **HW9** repo and check that it is also in your classmate **HW8** repo.

Each review will be reviewed and graded by me. (Please take this homework seriously: one sentence generic reviews will be graded 0)

## Assignment 2: census geospatial analysis. 
## Due in two weeks, the week after thanksgiving. Work in groups.

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/) data (really the 1-year survey data) and at the same time to make you exercise with spatial analysis in geopandas.
The goal is to assess if the [linkNYC](https://www.link.nyc/) stations are located to provide a useful service and to fill in a need. You will work with the American Fact Finder data via API and direct download, and with NYC shapefiles.
The homework is long but you have 2 weeks to do it. If you leave it to the last minute you may have a hard time!
